# Churn Prediction in Telecommunication Company
## Overview:
This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn in a telecommunication company. It was developed as the final project for the FGA Data Science Bootcamp in 2023. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn can help companies understand customer behavior and take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Data:
The dataset used in this project consists of historical customer data, including various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and services subscribed. The target variable is whether a customer churned or not.

## Techniques Used:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- Machine Learning Models: Employing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and KNN.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Library:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Sklearn
